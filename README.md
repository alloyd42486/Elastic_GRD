# Summary

Supporting material for the paper "Reciprocity and sensitivity kernels for sea level fingerprints" by Al-Attar *et al.* (2023)
which has been submitted to GJI. The codes and model files provided here are sufficient to reproduce all calculations and figures
within the submitted paper. The Jupyter notebook MakeFigures.ipynb can be used to generate the figures interactively or to experiment more
generally with the methods. The Python3 script MakeFigures.py can be used to generate all figures and save them to a given location.

# Dependencies

A list of all key import statements can be seen in the script SLmod.py. Beyond standard things (matplotlib, numpy) the calculations
require the "PYSHTOOLS" library (https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/using-with-python.html) and "cartpoy" (https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/).
Both can be readily installed using pip or similar.
